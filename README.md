Deep Learning for Hate Speech Detection: A Comparative Study

The widespread use of social media has amplified the need to combat hate speech, which often manifests in various harmful forms. Automated detection systems, particularly those leveraging deep learning, have emerged as critical tools to tackle this challenge. These systems must navigate the complexities of linguistic diversity, contextual nuances, and the scale of online interactions while maintaining accuracy and efficiency. The development and comparison of various detection methods are vital to understanding their capabilities and limitations, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by hate speech in real-world scenarios.

Abstract

Automated hate speech detection is an important tool in combating the spread of hate speech, particularly in social media. Numerous methods have been developed for the task, including a recent proliferation of deep-learning based approaches. A variety of datasets have also been developed, exemplifying various manifestations of the hate-speech detection problem. We present
here a large-scale empirical comparison of deep and shallow hate-speech detection methods, mediated through the three most commonly used datasets. Our goal is to illuminate progress in the
area, and identify strengths and weaknesses in the current state-of-the-art. We particularly focus our analysis on measures of practical performance, including detection effectiveness, computational efficiency, capability in using pre-trained models, and domain generalization. In doing so we aim to provide guidance as to the use of hate-speech detection in practice, quantify the state-of-the-art, and identify future research directions.

Result

Through excellent classification accuracy and the capacity to distinguish between distinct hatespeech classes across multiple datasets, the project's outcomes demonstrate the accuracy ofmachine learning models in identifying hate speech. Although some biases in detection ratesstill exist, especially with regard to racial and cultural differences, the evaluation shows that themodels can detect harmful content in a variety of linguistic forms. Even though the results showstrong performance, more work needs to be done, particularly to address these biases andimprove the interpretability of the model. The models' use in practical situations could begreatly enhanced by optimizing them for more accurate domain generalization and fairness.
